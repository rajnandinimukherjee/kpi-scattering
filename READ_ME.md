# Kaon-pion scattering analysis code

This project allows a user to run through the entire Kpi scattering analysis by themselves
and inspect all correlations functions and fit variations that ultimately lead to 
the calculation of the Kpi scattering lengths for the isospin channels I=1/2, 3/2.

It is encouraged to use an interactive python version, such as `iPython`, to run
these scripts and inspect the correlation functions as objects.

The most important results can be viewed right away by running [run_through.py](run_through.py), 
however, one can go through the entire analysis step-by-step if they wish using
the other scripts in this folder. 

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/rajnandinimukherjee/kpi-scattering/wiki) for a more
complete description.
